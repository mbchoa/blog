## "Oh man, another React guide?"

You might be thinking that.  And if you are thinking that, I totally get you.  React has been around for a while now (since ~2012) and it has certainly matured quite nicely.  It's adoption and usage has rapidly spread through the web development community like wildfire since it's initial release to the world.  Let's just say, if you've been working in the web dev sphere and haven't heard of React, then you're either VERY new to the scene OR you've been living under a rock (jk). So the question begs to be asked again...

"Why another guide?"

I've had the great fortune of working on a large scale ecommerce React web app for roughly 9 months now and since starting the gig, I've been able to pick up and learn many things that I wish I could have known on Day 1.  This post and eventually series will be my attempt to record some of the good and bad I've learned working with a non-trivial React project and by extension, the ecosystem surrounding React.
